## 📰 News

- 2023/11/10 The technical report is now available on [arXiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.05332)!

## 📌 Introduction

In our paper, we explore the revolutionary GPT-4V, a visionary in the field of autonomous driving. Here, you'll find a treasure trove of original test images and in-depth results demonstrating the model's capabilities in understanding complex driving scenes and making decisions like a seasoned driver.

## 🚀 Usage

Dive into our insightful findings by exploring the categorized directories:

- `Scenario Understanding`: Tests on GPT-4V's perception of its environment and fellow road-goers.
- `Reasoning`: A peek into the model's advanced reasoning capabilities.
- `Act as A Driver`: Scenes where GPT-4V showcases its driving acumen.

Each case within these categories is accompanied by a `.json` file detailing the prompts and responses from GPT-4V, alongside a `.png` image that the model assessed.
