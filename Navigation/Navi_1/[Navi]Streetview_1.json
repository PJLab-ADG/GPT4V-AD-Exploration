  "question": "Please combine the navigation on map APP and the front-view camera image of the car. Write a paragraph to instruct how to drive in the current situation to the driver behind the wheel.",
  "answer": "In your current position, you are on Avenue Kléber. Ahead of you, you'll see a broad street lined with trees on either side and buildings with classic Parisian architecture. On your navigation map, you're approaching a slight right turn onto Avenue Paul Doumer in about 50 meters. As you drive, monitor your speed since the speed limit is 30 km/h, and currently, you're going at 49 km/h. Pay attention to the surrounding traffic and pedestrians. Soon after the slight right, you will continue straight on Avenue Kléber. Your destination appears to be close, with an estimated 404 meters to go and an approximate arrival time of 12:11. Ensure that you follow road signs and traffic signals and drive safely."
