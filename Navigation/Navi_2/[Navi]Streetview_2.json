  "question": "Please combine the navigation on map APP and the front-view camera image of the car. Write a paragraph to instruct how to drive in the current situation to the driver behind the wheel.",
  "answer": "In your current position, you're approaching an intersection on Longyao Rd. You'll need to make a left turn in approximately 80 meters. As you can see from the front-view camera image of your car, the road ahead is clear with minimal traffic. Ensure you signal in advance and check both sides for oncoming traffic or pedestrians before making the turn. Once you've made the left turn onto Longyao Rd, continue straight and maintain a speed close to 52 km/h, but always adjust to the current traffic conditions and any speed limits posted. Your destination is roughly 4.4 km away and is estimated to take you another 16 minutes to reach. Safe driving!"
